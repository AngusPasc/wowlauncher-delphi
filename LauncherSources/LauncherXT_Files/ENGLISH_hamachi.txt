       PLEASE READ THIS GUIDE!

# Once setup has finished, Hamachi detects if you are running the program for the first time and will run a Quick Guide for new users to acquaint themselves with the program basics. By following this guide, you will be set up with a Hamachi address.

NOTE: Once recorded  will be assigned to you a number that will be visualized on the top of hamachi window (like this:5.49.162.83). If this happens it means that you have been connected to Hamachi!

# The next step is to click on the Networks button. In the menu that appears, select Join existing network.

# Then you must insert the "Network name" and the "Network password" of your realm


 
RULES:

# generally it is prohibited to be connected at 2 or more Hamachi networks of the same realm (this embezzles space for the new users)
NOTE: ALL users of ALL networks of the same realm will be logged in the SAME WOW realm when you are playing! 

# The Admins, sometimes, make a cleaning of hamachi networks, this means the networks will be reset and you must "rejoin" the network whenever the cleaning is carried out.
